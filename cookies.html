                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>1. What Are Cookies?</h4>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the site owners. Cookies allow websites to recognize users and remember their preferences, such as login details, shopping cart contents, and other personalized settings. They are essential for many modern website features and help provide a seamless browsing experience.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>2. How We Use Cookies</h4>
                    <p>HomieHoney uses cookies for several purposes: to enable basic website functionality, analyze how visitors use our site, personalize content and ads, provide social media features, and improve your browsing experience. We use both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device for a set period). These cookies help us understand user behavior, remember your preferences, and deliver content tailored to your interests. Our use of cookies complies with applicable privacy laws and regulations.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h4>
                    <p>We utilize several categories of cookies: Strictly Necessary cookies that are essential for website operation, Performance cookies that collect anonymous data about usage, Functionality cookies that remember your preferences, and Targeting cookies that deliver relevant ads. Each type serves a specific purpose in enhancing your experience. Strictly Necessary cookies cannot be disabled as they are crucial for basic functions, while others can be managed through your browser settings or our cookie consent tool. We periodically review our cookie usage to ensure alignment with best practices and legal requirements.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>4. First-Party vs Third-Party Cookies</h4>
                    <p>First-party cookies are set by our website directly and are generally used to remember your preferences and improve functionality. Third-party cookies are set by domains other than ours, typically by our partners for services like analytics, advertising, and social media integration. While we control the use of first-party cookies, third-party cookies are subject to the privacy policies of the respective providers. We carefully select third-party services that respect user privacy and provide clear information about their data practices.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>5. Cookie Lifespan</h4>
                    <p>Cookies have varying lifespans: session cookies expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device for a predetermined period (from a few days to several years). We set reasonable expiration periods based on each cookie's purpose, balancing functionality needs with privacy considerations. Essential cookies typically have longer lifespans, while analytics and advertising cookies are usually set for shorter durations. You can manually delete cookies through your browser settings at any time.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>6. Similar Technologies</h4>
                    <p>Beyond traditional cookies, we may use similar tracking technologies like web beacons, pixels, and local storage. These technologies help us understand user behavior, deliver personalized content, and measure ad performance. Web beacons are tiny graphics that record if a page has been viewed, while local storage allows more data to be stored on your device than cookies. These technologies are subject to the same consent requirements as cookies under applicable laws.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>7. Legal Basis for Cookie Use</h4>
                    <p>Our use of cookies is based on different legal grounds depending on their type: Strictly Necessary cookies are used based on our legitimate interest in website operation, while all other cookies require your consent. We obtain consent through our cookie banner when you first visit our site. You can withdraw or modify your consent at any time through our cookie settings panel. Our practices comply with the GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant privacy regulations.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>8. International Data Transfers</h4>
                    <p>Some third-party services we use may transfer cookie data outside your country of residence. When this occurs, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers outside the EEA. Our analytics providers may process data in various global locations, but we require them to maintain adequate protection regardless of where processing occurs. You can find specific information about data transfers in our Privacy Policy.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>9. Cookie Management</h4>
                    <p>You have several options for managing cookies: using our cookie consent tool to select which types to allow, adjusting browser settings to block or delete cookies, or using third-party tools to manage tracking. Note that disabling certain cookies may affect website functionality. Most browsers allow you to view and delete cookies, block third-party cookies, or set preferences for specific websites. We provide clear instructions in our cookie settings panel to help you make informed choices.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>10. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h4>
                    <p>While you can disable most cookies through your browser settings, doing so may significantly affect your experience on our website. Essential functions like logging in, shopping cart retention, and preference saving may not work properly. Some content may not display correctly, and personalized features will be limited. We recommend keeping at least Strictly Necessary cookies enabled for full functionality. Our cookie settings panel allows you to disable non-essential cookies while maintaining core features.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>11. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h4>
                    <p>These essential cookies enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility. They include cookies that remember your consent preferences, maintain your session during navigation, and enable e-commerce transactions. Without these cookies, our website cannot function properly. Examples include our shopping cart cookie (cart_id), session authentication cookie (session_id), and consent preference cookie (cookie_consent). These cookies do not collect personal information for marketing purposes and are always active regardless of your consent settings.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>12. Performance Cookies</h4>
                    <p>Performance cookies collect anonymous information about how visitors use our website, helping us improve its functionality. These cookies track pages visited, time spent on site, error messages, and navigation paths. We use tools like Google Analytics (with IP anonymization) to analyze this data. The information is aggregated and cannot be used to identify individuals. These cookies help us understand which content performs best, identify usability issues, and make data-driven improvements to our site structure and content.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>13. Functionality Cookies</h4>
                    <p>Functionality cookies remember your preferences and choices to provide enhanced, personalized features. They may store your language preference, region settings, login information (if you choose "remember me"), and customized layout options. These cookies make your experience more convenient by eliminating the need to repeatedly set preferences. While not strictly necessary for website operation, they significantly improve usability. Examples include our language preference cookie (user_lang) and theme selection cookie (site_theme).</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>14. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h4>
                    <p>These cookies track your browsing habits to deliver relevant advertising and measure campaign effectiveness. They may be set by us or our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests and show you targeted ads on our site and others. While these cookies don't store personal information directly, they can identify your browser and internet device. We use them sparingly and provide clear opt-out options. Examples include Facebook Pixel cookies and Google Ads cookies for remarketing purposes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>15. Social Media Cookies</h4>
                    <p>Social media cookies are set by social platforms when you interact with their content on our site, such as sharing buttons or embedded feeds. These cookies allow social networks to track your activity across sites that use their services. While we don't control these cookies, we carefully select social media partners who respect user privacy. These cookies may be used to personalize your experience on the social platform or target advertising. Examples include LinkedIn share buttons and Twitter embedded tweets.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h4>16. Cookie Expiration Periods</h4>
                    <p>Our cookies have varying expiration periods based on their purpose: session cookies expire when you close your browser, authentication cookies typically last 30 days, preference cookies may persist for 1 year, and analytics cookies usually expire after 2 years. We regularly review these periods to ensure they're no longer than necessary. Advertising cookies generally have shorter lifespans (30-90 days) to limit prolonged tracking. You can see specific expiration times for each cookie in our detailed cookie list below.</p>

                    <h4>18. Third-Party Services</h4>
                    <p>We integrate several third-party services that may set cookies: Google Analytics for website statistics, Facebook Pixel for ad measurement, Hotjar for user experience analysis, and Stripe for payment processing. These services have their own privacy policies and cookie practices. We vet all third-party providers for compliance with privacy laws and require them to implement appropriate safeguards. Links to their policies are available in our Privacy Policy and Cookie Settings panel.</p>

                    <h4>19. Cookie Consent Mechanism</h4>
                    <p>Our cookie consent solution allows granular control over cookie categories. When you first visit, our banner explains cookie use and requests consent for non-essential cookies. You can accept all, reject all, or customize settings. Your preferences are stored in a cookie (cookie_consent) so we remember your choices. The system automatically blocks non-essential cookies until consent is given. You can update preferences anytime via the Cookie Settings link in our footer. We log consents to demonstrate compliance.</p>

                    <h4>20. Do Not Track Signals</h4>
                    <p>Our website currently doesn't respond to Do Not Track (DNT) browser signals as there's no industry standard for implementation. However, our cookie consent tool provides similar control by allowing you to opt out of tracking cookies. We monitor developments in DNT technology and may implement support in the future if standards emerge. In the meantime, our cookie settings offer comprehensive control over tracking technologies used on our site.</p>

                    <h4>21. Managing Cookie Preferences</h4>
                    <p>You can manage cookie preferences through our Cookie Settings panel accessible from every page footer. The panel provides detailed information about each cookie category and allows you to toggle them on/off individually. Changes take effect immediately and are remembered for future visits. For more technical users, we provide instructions for managing cookies through popular browsers. Note that blocking certain cookies may require you to manually re-enter information or reset preferences on subsequent visits.</p>

                    <h4>22. Browser Cookie Controls</h4>
                    <p>All modern browsers allow cookie management through their settings. Typically, you can find these under "Privacy" or "Security" sections. Common options include blocking third-party cookies, deleting existing cookies, or setting exceptions for specific sites. We recommend consulting your browser's help documentation for precise instructions. Note that blocking all cookies may prevent some websites (including ours) from functioning properly. Browser settings override our cookie consent tool, so adjustments there may affect your experience.</p>

                    <h4>23. Opting Out of Analytics</h4>
                    <p>To opt out of Google Analytics tracking, you can install Google's opt-out browser add-on or adjust our cookie settings to disable Performance cookies. For other analytics providers, we include opt-out links in our Cookie Settings panel. When you opt out, a special cookie is placed to remember your preference. Note that this doesn't stop data collection entirely—it just prevents the use of cookies for analytics purposes. Server logs and other anonymous tracking methods may still record basic visit information.</p>

                    <h4>24. Advertising Opt-Outs</h4>
                    <p>To opt out of interest-based advertising, you can use our cookie settings to disable Targeting cookies or visit industry opt-out platforms like the Digital Advertising Alliance (aboutads.info) or Network Advertising Initiative (optout.networkadvertising.org). These programs allow blanket opt-outs from participating companies. Mobile users can adjust ad tracking in device settings. Opting out doesn't mean you'll see fewer ads—just that they may be less relevant. You'll still need to manage cookies separately for each device and browser.</p>

                    <p>Under GDPR and other privacy laws, you have rights regarding your personal data collected through cookies, including access, rectification, erasure, and restriction of processing. To exercise these rights, contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@homiehoney.com. For cookie-related requests, we may need to verify your identity. Most cookie preferences can be managed directly through our settings panel without formal requests. We respond to all valid requests within one month as required by law.</p>

                    <p>We don't knowingly use cookies to collect personal information from children under 16 without parental consent. Our website isn't directed at children, and we implement age-screening measures where appropriate. Parents can contact us to review or delete any data collected from their children. We recommend parents educate children about online privacy and supervise their internet use, including cookie management. Most browsers offer parental controls that can restrict cookie usage.</p>

While we don't "sell" data in the traditional sense, you can opt out of targeted advertising cookies through our settings panel. California users may request information about cookie-related data sharing for direct marketing purposes. Requests can be made via our Privacy Request form or by calling our toll-free number.</p>

These include the right to withdraw consent (via our settings panel), right to access information about data processing, and right to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities.

Session cookies expire after inactivity, and authentication cookies are encrypted. We limit cookie access to authorized personnel and services. While no system is completely secure, we follow industry standards to minimize risks. Users should protect their devices with antivirus software and keep browsers updated for optimal security.</p>

                    <h4>33. Cookie Settings Documentation</h4>
                    <p>We maintain detailed documentation of our cookie implementation, including technical specifications, consent mechanisms, and compliance measures. This documentation helps ensure consistent application of our policies across all digital properties. While primarily for internal use, summarized versions are available to regulators upon request. Our development teams receive regular training on proper cookie implementation and privacy-by-design principles to minimize data collection and maximize user control.</p>

                    <h4>34. Compliance Monitoring</h4>
                    <p>We conduct regular audits of our cookie usage to ensure compliance with this policy and applicable laws. These audits review cookie types, purposes, durations, and consent mechanisms. We monitor regulatory developments and adjust our practices accordingly. Any non-compliance identified during audits is promptly remediated. We maintain records of consent and cookie settings to demonstrate compliance with accountability principles. Third-party vendors are periodically reviewed for continued adherence to our standards.</p>

                    <h4>35. Employee Training</h4>
                    <p>All employees involved in website development, marketing, or data processing receive training on proper cookie implementation and privacy requirements. Training covers legal obligations, user rights, consent mechanisms, and secure coding practices. Specialized staff receive additional instruction on cookie consent management platforms and analytics configurations. We maintain training records and update materials regularly to reflect policy changes and emerging best practices in digital privacy.</p>

                    <h4>36. Vendor Management</h4>
                    <p>We carefully select third-party vendors that align with our privacy values. All vendors using cookies on our behalf must comply with this policy and applicable laws. Contracts include data protection clauses and usage restrictions. We conduct due diligence on vendors' privacy practices and technical safeguards. Regular reviews assess ongoing compliance, and non-compliant vendors are replaced. Users can identify vendor cookies through our settings panel and opt out where possible.</p>

                    <h4>37. Incident Response</h4>
                    <p>In the event of a security incident involving cookie data (such as unauthorized access), we have procedures to contain, assess, and remediate the issue. Serious breaches affecting personal data are reported to regulators and affected individuals as required by law. Our incident response team includes privacy, legal, and technical experts who coordinate investigations and implement corrective actions. Post-incident reviews identify improvements to prevent recurrence.</p>

                    <h4>38. International Considerations</h4>
                    <p>We tailor our cookie practices to meet regional requirements. EU visitors receive GDPR-compliant consent prompts, while California users see CCPA-specific options. Our systems detect user locations to apply appropriate standards, though all users can access the same controls through our settings panel. When transferring data internationally, we use approved mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses. Users worldwide benefit from our commitment to privacy regardless of their jurisdiction's specific laws.</p>

                    <h4>39. Alternative Solutions</h4>
                    <p>Where possible, we implement cookie-less alternatives for analytics and functionality. These include server-side tracking (with anonymized IPs), privacy-preserving APIs, and first-party data collection methods. When cookies are necessary, we minimize their scope and duration. We're actively exploring emerging technologies like Privacy Sandbox that aim to balance functionality with enhanced privacy protections. Our development roadmap prioritizes privacy-enhancing innovations.</p>

                    <h4>40. Future Developments</h4>
                    <p>We continuously monitor evolving privacy standards and technologies to improve our cookie practices. Planned enhancements include more granular consent options, additional cookie-less tracking alternatives, and improved user education materials. We participate in industry groups shaping future privacy standards and contribute to open-source projects developing privacy-focused web technologies.
